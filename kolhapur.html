   <h4><p>Kolhapur is one of the most significant cities in South Maharashtra and has been a hub of historical, religious, and cultural activities for centuries. It is famous for its unique food culture, including its signature Kolhapuri cuisine. The city is situated in the western part of Maharashtra and is often referred to as "Dakshin Kashi" or "Mahateerth". It boasts a rich history, which has given it various other names, including Kollagiri, Kolladigiripattan and Kollpur, all meaning "valley" [citation needed] Around 2 CE Kolhapur's name was 'Kuntal'.[1]

Kolhapur is known as 'Dakshin Kashi' or Kashi of the South because of its spiritual history and the antiquity of its shrine Mahalaxmi, better known as Ambabai.[6] The region is known for the production of the famous handcrafted and braided leather slippers called Kolhapuri chappal, which received the Geographical Indication designation in 2019.[7] In Hindu mythology, the city is referred to as "Karvir."[5]

Before India became independent in 1947, Kolhapur was a princely state under the Bhosale Chhatrapati of the Maratha Confederacy. It is an important centre for the Marathi film industry.[8]</p></h4>
